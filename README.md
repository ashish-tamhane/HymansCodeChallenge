# HymansCodeChallenge

Code summary:

1. Test driven development style is followed for the refactoring and new features.
2. Individual projects are added each for BaggageCalculator, Entities, FlightProceedCheck, LoyaltlyPointsCalculator, ProfitCalculator etc. This is done so as to keep code separation and clean coding guidelines.
3. Dependency injection technique is followed. MOQ can also be used over here in order to mock data but since this example does not depend on any external depedency it is not used.
